## Building Firmware

Various sizes and thumb-cluster styles are supported as keymaps. To build the firmware, use the command:
`qmk compile -kb cyboard/dactyl/{THUMB STYLE}_{ROWS} -km vial`
where `{THUMB STYLE}` can be `manuform`, `dual_arcs`, or `single_arc`
and `{ROWS}` can be `function_row`, `number_row`, or `letters_only`

## Flashing

To flash the firmware to your Cyboard,
1. Enter the bootloader by double-tapping the reset button on the back of the board.
2. A USB device called `RPI-RP2` should appear on your computer.
3. Drag the `.uf2` firmware file into `RPI-RP2`.  `RPI-RP2` should now disappear.
4. Repeat steps 1-3 on the other half.  Your Cyboard is ready to use with your new firmware!
